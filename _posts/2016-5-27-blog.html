<h2 class="text-xs-center">
    WHY do your start this blog?
</h2>

<p>
    I am a student pursuing an IT-related career upon graduation.
</p>
<p>
    In the past, I often let random ideas and trivial inspirations slip through my mind. Now, I want to write them down so that I can implement them and review the outcomes later.
</p>

<h2 class="text-xs-center">
    WHAT are you doing with this blog?
</h2>

<p>
    My blog name is “IniZio”,  an italian word meaning “start” in english. (Inizio is also the name of the student council candiate party I formed, but the party eventually got abandoned.) And these are the areas I am writing on:
    </p>
<dl>
        <dt>
            Study
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Study notes about intriguing ideas and concepts that need extra attention.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            Develop
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Bug fixes. Solutions. Changes and improvements of the product in my startup company interesting facts I learnt, software reviews.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            Game
        </dt>
        <dd>
            I am a Team Fortress 2 addict. I want to share my opinion on this game, the reason I got left out from my friends’ Division 1 team, stories about people I met, and Fantasy Fortress tales I created with my friend.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            Life
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Shower thoughts.
        </dd>
    </dl>


<h2 class="text-xs-center">
    WHEN do you blog?
</h2>

<p>
    Yup, I know I will forget about this blog too if I do not set a schedule to force myself to keep writing.
    </p>
<dl>
        <dt>
            Study
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Daily. I mean it.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            Develop
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Bi-weekly because I usually check my source codes every two weeks to see if I have broken something again.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            Game
        </dt>
        <dd>
            I am addicted to the game, but I don't want to fill my blog with game. I will go with bi-monthly, unlike the publication frequency of Mann. Co comics ;)
        </dd>
        <dt>
            Life
        </dt>
        <dd>
            I am not sure about this. I am gonna go with the flow.
